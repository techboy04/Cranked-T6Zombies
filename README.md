# Cranked - Plutonium T6 Zombies - Beta 0.5
I decided to recreate a Cranked mode in Zombies.

I did make this mode a little rough on the edges but it should work pretty well.

NOTE: Mob of the Dead currently does not work! All youre gonna get is an infinite loop which doesnt load the map!

The first kill will start the timer, every kill resets the timer, and every few rounds, the timer shrinks. Be the last alive to win! Once the timer runs out or you die, youre immediately eliminated! (No Quick Revive can save you now!)

All Mystery Boxes are available! (For now it uses Fire Sale but this will be polished in the near future)

By Default, there is no perk limit.

The mode also has custom powerups: (thanks to Ox_ for this part of the code)
- Teddy Bear: Pause the timer for a short period of time
- Bottomless Clip: You get unlimited ammo (by [Ox_](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/70/release-gsc-zombies-custom-powerup-unlimited-ammo?_=1719448667279))

## Installation
Download cranked.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)

You will have to open console and type in ```enable_cranked 1``` to enable this! This is so you can still have the script in your folder while also able to disable it if you want to use other mods! **YOU MAY HAVE TO START A MATCH BEFORE TO LOAD UP THE DVAR THEN RESTART THE MATCH AFTER YOU SET IT (This isnt needed if you specify it in a config folder for a dedicated server)**

## Got a Bug or a Suggestion?
As this mode is still being worked on, I accept suggestions and bugs. [Join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/dkwyDzW), Grab the Call of Duty role, and report it to [#technoops-forums](https://discord.com/channels/399600672586203137/1032884888468213811)
